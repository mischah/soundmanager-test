Just a testcase to show problems with the communication between Flash and Javascript via ExternalInterface.

In my case the problem occurs with SoundManager 2 in a hidden Container: SoundManager 2 just doesn’t work in IE Below 9 when using FlashPlayer.

**You may ask for what reason I should place sound in a hidden container.**

It’s for showing the inline playable mp3 links after a click. See the [example](http://mischah.github.com/soundmanager-test/)
